# getEmailList

Small tool to get a list of mails from a given list with multiple employees, duplicates included

### Details

Each line of the given list is read of the given. Each line then is divided into columns seperated of tabs. Each input list will have the same structure therefore always the 6th column will be needed for generating the list of emails.
The GUI is made of a button, a textfield and a menu to open a file dialog. The design is kept simple.

### TODOS
- Improve programm, e.g. use column with the needed names instead of a hardcoded column
